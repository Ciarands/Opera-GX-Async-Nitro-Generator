# Opera-GX-Async-Nitro-Generator
Opera GX had a [promotion](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/19822382831767-1-Month-Discord-Nitro-for-Opera-GX-Users-2023-Promo-FAQ) with discord, the distribution system was very vulnerable with no real protections or reasonable ratelimits, this allowed you to generate unlimited copies of discord nitro for this promotion.
